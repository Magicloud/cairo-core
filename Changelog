    Pretty Document
    
    DONE: Document formating. Current document just removes all formation,
    which looks ugly.

    Document generation, from URLs pointing to Cairo website.
    
    Even this is just a binding library. Proper docuemnt saves end user from
    opening another website and checking for naming and parameters
    difference.

    Fix Render generation logic. Now this package is rebuildable and works
    with haddock.
    
    Building system skips source files that are not changed after last
    building. Thus those files won't be scanned by `genRender`. Therefore
    target Render.hs did not contain methods from those since it was always
    from Render.hs in source.
    
    Now target Render.hs is checked first to see if this is just updating
    some Decls, or generating new from source.

    Update readme. Add `MonadIO Render` and `with`.
    
    `IO` action in `Render` cannot be done without `MonadIO Render`.
    
    `with` is `use` in `Render`.

    Cairo binding available with GHC 8.6. Trying to make this memory safe
    and typed.
    
    Haddock does not work yet.
